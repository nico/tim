tim
---

A silly little tool to time how long it takes to run a command. Similar to
"time" in bash, etc. but it can't be called "time" because the Windows shell
reserves that for the most useless utility ever.


Build
-----

From a vsvars32.bat shell (i.e. with compiler in the path):

  C:\...\tim>m.bat


Example
-------

  c:\src\proj>tim some.exe -with arguments
  some.exe: blah blorp
  some.exe: wee waa

  real: 0m3.947s

Meaning it took just under 4 seconds to run some.exe. tim has no command line
arguments, everything after its name is the subcommand.
